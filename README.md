# CYW920721M2EVK-02

### Overview

The Infineon CYW920721M2EVK-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth&#174; applications using the CYW20721, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.4 wireless MCU device for Audio. The CYW20721 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth&#174; LE/BR/EDR. The CYW20721 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.

* CYW20721B2 dual-mode (LE/BR/EDR) Bluetooth&#174; 5.4-compliant wireless MCU packaged into a SiP Module with external 8TR8211C Low Noise Amplifier and Power Amplifier (eLNA/ePA)
* Audio Arduino shield with on-board analog microphones, audio codec chip, headphone and speaker output
* On-board sensors - an ambient light sensor, thermistor, and footprint for an Infineon digital microphone
* User switches and LEDs
* USB connector for power, programming, and USB-UART bridge

### Kit Contents

* CYW9BTM2BASE1 base board
* CYW920721M2EPA2 Bluetooth&#174; radio card (mounted on the base board)
* CYW9BT Audio 3 Arduino shield (pre-assembled on top of the CYW9BTM2BASE1)
* USB Standard-A to Micro-B cable
* Power Adapter

### Additional Information

* Max UART baud rate is 3M.
* ADC\_INPUT\_P0 used in the hal/adc code example routes to D7 on the board, J4 pin 1. When the AUDIO3 shield is used, this routes to the CUSTOM button on the shield.
